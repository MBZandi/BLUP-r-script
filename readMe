Finally you get the results as follow:
BV.txt ==> include the estimated Breeding Value(BV) of each animal in the pedgigree
Fixed.txt ==> include the estimated effect of Fixed factors for all subclases
h2.txt ==> include the Predicted Heritabilty of the trait
VCE.txt ==> include the Pridicted (Co)Variances, line one is Genetic Variance and second line is Environment variance
blupoutput.txt ==> include the estimated Breeding Value(BV), Etimated fixed effect based on MME
